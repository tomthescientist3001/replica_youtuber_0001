### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analysing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: the primary used for this analysis is the "sales_data/csv" file, containing information about each sale made by the company.

### Data Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
  - [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports



### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeble peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LIV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximise revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LIV customer effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omission but even then, we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
